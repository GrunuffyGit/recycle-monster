# Welcome to Recycle Monster

Recycle monster is a game that teaches proper recycling to its users. There are images of recyclables, compost, and garbage passed through the screen and itâ€™s up to the player to sort them in the right bins before the recycle monster can eat it! The player wins if the monster shrinks and goes into hibernation. The player loses if the monster eats enough recyclables to grow into a fiery giant that destroys the earth.

Created with Javascript, NodeJS, Express, PostreSQL, React, and PIXI
